Completing Assignments
=====

Overview
--------
A key goal of this course is to develop the software design, testing, and other skills
needed to successfully build complex software products. The course will focus on 
building real software applications and applying the principles learned in the course
to the development of these applications. A key part of the course will be the use of
open version control systems, interactive in-class discussions of everyone's code, and
peer code reviews. You will learn to both apply software engineering techniques and 
principles as well as critique their application in other code bases and suggest
refactorings.


Almost every week, there will be a new coding assignment due. The assignments will be
due at midnight on Sunday. On Monday morning, you will be assigned another student's
code to perform a code review on. The course will use a standard code review form that
is in the Code\_Review\_Forms directory. You must suggest a minimum of three refactorings
for each project and write them down. 

Handing in the Initial Implementation
-------------------------------------
The initial implementation of your assignments should be handed in by placing them in a
"AsgnX" (e.g., Asgn2) sub-folder of your repo's "impl" folder and then checking them
into the "dev" branch of your GitHub project. You MUST push your changes to the GitHub
server so that your code reviewer can clone your project and review it. Your assignment
will be considered completed on time only if it is pushed to GitHub before the due date.
You can easily open the GitHub web page for your repo to double check that it has been
pushed.

Handing in Code Reviews
-----------------------
Code reviews should be placed in a "reviews" folder in your repo and pushed to GitHub.
The code review form should be renamed "AsgnX".
